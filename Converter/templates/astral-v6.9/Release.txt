**LITE VERSION**:
────────────────────────────
We've noticed that Astral V6 is a heavy UI pack. To compensate for low-end devices, we've decided to make
a Lite version.

**What features are not on the Lite version?**
1. Java UI for the **Play Screen**
2. Panorama
3. Custom inventory, containers, hotbar, buttons and dialogs.
4. Shaders (No Fog and Highlight selection)
────────────────────────────
The Default Edits and Archives of previous versions are on the website.
It is **not** recommended to use bottom chat if you're a mobile player. It may cause a lot of issues and bugs. Bottom Chat
is meant to be for Win10 edition players. If you wish to use it, use it at your own risk.
